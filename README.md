The Inventory Tracker application was created to solve a problem for users who wanted a simple, mobile solution to meet their inventory data requirements. The primary goal of the app was to serve as a usable interface for the user to conduct simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions with the use of a local SQLite database. The generated app contains many screens; a login screen, an inventory dashboard, item detail views and an SMS permission interface screen. Each screen arranged to meet the user-centered design approach, which includes an interface that is easy to navigate, limits user input, contains visual hierarchy, and free of extraneous elements. I developed the UI for Project Two and used it as a starting point for Project Three will mean that I remained consistent and true to my original intention in design. These features will be especially handy as a simple tool for small business owners and inventory managers utilizing a lightweight, simple daily use mobile application.
Throughout the development process, I approached coding in a modular and iterative way. I broke my code into Java classes and XML layouts and used Android Studio to organize everything in a manner that made sense with respect to Android data persistence (SQLite), user interface, and user input. I verified functionality by running the app from emulators and physical devices to have features communicate as expected. This process also allowed me to document potential edge cases (special cases) in reasons for why the apps were working or not working and if I had missed dealing with them. Functionality testing helped me identify things related to user input validation and certain navigation issues, which I resolved to make my apps more stable. One implementation I was able to work through was the dealing of Android's SMS permissions since this is dynamic. In the end, I handled that by using real-time permission checks as it is appropriate with the relevant Android API levels. One of my biggest accomplishments is illustrating that I can make a data driven app using Java, Android parts, best practices for designing and implementing user interfaces, and of course my fulfillment by completing what I originally set out to do with the SQLite database interaction through view elements.
